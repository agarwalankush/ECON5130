# Machine Learning in Finance with Python 

Author: Ankush Agarwal, University of Glasgow

## Units

This introductory course consists of ten units. Each unit corresponds
to one interactive Jupyter notebook, which is also available
as a static PDF file. 

The lecture content is based on the books *Machine Learning with Pytorch and Scikit-learn* by @rasbt.
